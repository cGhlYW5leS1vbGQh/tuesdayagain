A simple Chrome extension providing motivation on Tuesdays.  
Enjoy the simple pleasure of seeing the Tuesday Again No Problem Dog on Tuesdays.  
On other days? There isn't much.  

I may choose to add "spin offs" for the other days.  For example, something like "Thursday Again? No trouble!" or whatever I can find that someone else has already come up with.
